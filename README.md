## Introduction

`The Dragon Code Styler` is an opinionated PHP code style fixer for minimalists.
`Codestyler` is built on top of [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint)
and [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer), and makes it simple to ensure that your code style
stays clean and consistent.

By default, `Codestyler` does not require any configuration and will fix code style issues in your code by following
the opinionated coding style of `The Dragon Code` based on the [`PER`](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/) rule
set.

## Installation

### Required

- PHP: ^8.1
- Composer: ^2.0

### Locally

```bash
composer global require dragon-code/codestyler
```

## Usage

When you run the commands in the base path of the project, the `composer.json` file will be automatically read, from
which the minimum PHP version for your project will be taken.

This is necessary to draw up rules for applying the Codestyler.

For example, if your project supports PHP 8.0 and above, and you use the `mkdir($path, 0755)` function in it, then
applying the rules for PHP 8.0 will break your code because it
will replace `0755` with `0o755` (`mkdir($path, 0o755)`).

To prevent this from happening, we check the minimum PHP version.

Please note that the `composer.json` file is only read if the script execution is started in the folder with it.

### CLI

```bash
# Check code-style
codestyle --test

# Fix code-style
codestyle

# Update `.editorconfig`
codestyle editorconfig

# Update Dependabot rules
codestyle dependabot

# Publishes code-style settings for the phpStorm IDE
codestyle phpstorm

# Show list of available commands
codestyle list
```

### Options

#### Path

The path to fix

```bash
codestyle foo/bar
```

#### Test

Test for code style errors without fixing them

```bash
codestyle --test
```

#### Config

The configuration that should be used. The target directory will read the `pint.json` file
from [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint), minus the style set.

```bash
codestyle --config=foo/bar
```

#### Risky

Allows to set whether risky rules may run:

```bash
codestyle --risky --test
codestyle --risky
```

#### Dirty

Only fix files that have uncommitted changes.

```bash
codestyle --dirty
```

#### Output Format

The output format that should be used.

```bash
codestyle --format
```

List of available formats:

- checkstyle
- gitlab
- json
- junit
- txt
- xml

#### Help Commands

To view the list of available commands, you can call the console command:

```bash
codestyle list
```

To view extended information on a command, you can use the `help` option. For example,

```bash
codestyle --help
codestyle dependabot --help
codestyle editorconfig --help
```

### GitHub Action

Create a new `.github/workflows/code-style.yml` file and add the content to it:

```yaml
name: Code Style

on: [ push, pull_request ]

jobs:
    fix:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            -   name: Checkout code
                uses: actions/checkout@v2

            -   name: Code style fix
                uses: TheDragonCode/codestyler@v3
                with:
                    # This token uses GitHub Actions to execute code.
                    # Required when `fix` is `true`.
                    # The default value is `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.
                    github_token: ${{ secrets.CODE_STYLE_TOKEN }}

                    # Activates the mode of accepting changes with the creation
                    # of commits.
                    fix: true

                    # Activates the actualization of the `.editorconfig` file.
                    # Works only when the `fix` option is enabled.
                    # By default, true
                    editorconfig: true

                    # Activates Dependabot file processing.
                    # Works only when the `fix` option is enabled.
                    # By default, true
                    dependabot: true

                    # Normalizing `composer.json`.
                    # Works only when the `fix` option is enabled.
                    # By default, true
                    normalize: true
```

Since the changes are pushed to the master branch, GitHub can block this action with a security policy.

To solve this problem, you need to
be [`create`](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=The%20Dragon%20Code:%20Styler) of your
account token and specify it
in the `Actions secrets` section of the repository or organization.

The name of the variable containing the token must be passed to the `github_token` key.

#### Simplify Check & Fix

```yaml
name: Code Style

on: [ push, pull_request ]

permissions: write-all

jobs:
    style:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            -   name: Checkout code
                uses: actions/checkout@v3

            -   name: Detect job name
                id: detect
                run: |
                    [[ ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }} ]] && NAME="Fix" || NAME="Check"

                    echo "name=${NAME}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

            -   name: ${{ steps.detect.outputs.name }} the code style
                uses: TheDragonCode/codestyler@v3
                with:
                    github_token: ${{ secrets.CODE_STYLE_TOKEN }}
                    fix: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}

```

### Other CI/CD

```bash
composer global require dragon-code/codestyler

codestyle <command>
```

### IDE

After executing the `codestyle editorconfig` console command, a `.editorconfig` file will be added to your application.
If the file already exists, it will be replaced.

In order for your IDE to read the code style settings from it, make sure its support is enabled in the settings.

For example, in `phpStorm` the setting is in
the [File | Settings | Editor | Code Style](jetbrains://PhpStorm/settings?name=Editor--Code+Style):

![image](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/codestyler/assets/10347617/0a0ac61e-f297-41c9-b034-4ae52ea96da6)

You can also use the `codestyle phpstorm` console command to publish the schema xml file to phpStorm.
You can import this file into the IDE.

## Configuration

By default, the linter scans all files in the current launch folder, except for folders such as `vendor`, `node_modules`
and `.github`.

```yaml
-   uses: TheDragonCode/codestyler@v3
```

By default, the linter only checks the code-style. If you want to apply the changes, then you need to activate this
option:

```yaml
-   uses: TheDragonCode/codestyler@v3
    with:
        fix: true
```

By default, GitHub Action does not allow versioning, so our project will create a configuration file for it, which will
check for new versions once a day.

When Dependabot detects new versions of containers, it will automatically create a PR to your repository. So you don't
need to keep track of updates - Dependabot will do everything
for you ðŸ’ªðŸ˜Ž

If the `.github/dependabot.yml` file has already been created, we will check it and add the necessary rules. So don't be
afraid, nothing will be deleted ðŸ˜Ž

> Note
>
> Files will be created only if you have specified `fix: true`.
>
> Or you can manually run the Dependabot rule creation script by executing the `codestyle dependabot` command.
